# Porject Information
**Title: How to record and publish display/window videos**
**Author: Ryan Woods - Rsw7vc**
> In this project I created a tutorial of how to screen record on your computer screen. I also showed the download process of software to the setup and actual recording process and went through different features. After that, I then showed how to save the recording and then as an example of sharing the recording I showed the process of uploading the recording to Youtube. This project is the instructions using markdown pages. I added the photos files used in the pages just to make sure they worked fully, thats why there are so many files in the repository.
> A target audience for this tutorial could honestly be anyone of any age, I think this would be a helpful tutorial for use in school or in a business. The target audience can be anyone for this type of task. 

My pages are labeled as follows:
1. InstructionsPage1.md
2. InstructionsPage2.md
