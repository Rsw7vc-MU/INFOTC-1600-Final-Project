# INFOTC-1600-Final-Project
Create a tutorial in markdown that is hosted on GitHub and focuses on a digital concept, system, or process.

In this project I created a tutorial of how to screen record on your computer. I showed the download process of software to the setup and actual recording process and went through different features. After that I then showed how to edit and save the recording and then as an example of sharing the recording I showed the process of uploading the recording to Youtube. This project is the instructions using markdown pages. I added the photos used in the pages just to make sure they worked fully.
